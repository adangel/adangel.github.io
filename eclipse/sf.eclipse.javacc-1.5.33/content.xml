In this respect, the Licensee&apos;s&#xA;attention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading,&#xA;using, modifying and/or developing and reproducing the Software&#xA;which are reserved for experienced users.&#xA;The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all&#xA;means, the product&apos;s suitability for its requirements, its good&#xA;working order, and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage&#xA;to either persons or properties.&#xA;9.2 The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is&#xA;entitled to grant all the rights over the Software (including&#xA;in particular the rights set forth in Article 5).&#xA;9.3 The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied &quot;as&#xA;is&quot; by the Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty,&#xA;other than that provided for in Article 9.2 and, in particular,&#xA;without any warranty as to its commercial value, its secured,&#xA;safe, innovative or relevant nature.&#xA;Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software&#xA;is free from any error, that it will operate without interruption,&#xA;that it will be compatible with the Licensee&apos;s own equipment&#xA;and software configuration, nor that it will meet the Licensee&apos;s&#xA;requirements.&#xA;9.4 The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant&#xA;that the Software does not infringe any third party intellectual&#xA;property right relating to a patent, software or any other property&#xA;right. Therefore, the Licensor disclaims any and all liability&#xA;towards the Licensee arising out of any or all proceedings for&#xA;infringement that may be instituted in respect of the use, modification&#xA;and redistribution of the Software. Nevertheless, should such&#xA;proceedings be instituted against the Licensee, the Licensor&#xA;shall provide it with technical and legal assistance for its&#xA;defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be decided&#xA;on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the&#xA;Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding.

However,&#xA;any licenses that it may have granted prior to termination of&#xA;the Agreement shall remain valid subject to their having been&#xA;granted in compliance with the terms and conditions hereof.&#xA;Article 11 - MISCELLANEOUS&#xA;11.1 EXCUSABLE EVENTS&#xA;Neither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or failure&#xA;to perform the Agreement, that may be attributable to an event&#xA;of force majeure, an act of God or an outside cause, such as&#xA;defective functioning or interruptions of the electricity or&#xA;telecommunications networks, network paralysis following a virus&#xA;attack, intervention by government authorities, natural disasters,&#xA;water damage, earthquakes, fire, explosions, strikes and labor&#xA;unrest, war, etc.&#xA;11.2 Any Failure by either Party, on one or more occasions, to&#xA;invoke one or more of the provisions hereof, shall under no circumstances&#xA;be interpreted as being a waiver by the interested Party of its&#xA;right to invoke said provision(s) subsequently.&#xA;11.3 The Agreement cancels and replaces any or all previous agreements,&#xA;whether written or oral, between the Parties and having the same&#xA;purpose, and constitutes the entirety of the agreement between&#xA;said Parties concerning said purpose. No supplement or modification&#xA;to the terms and conditions hereof shall be effective as between&#xA;the Parties unless it is made in writing and signed by their&#xA;duly authorized representatives.&#xA;11.4 In the event that one or more of the provisions hereof were&#xA;to conflict with a current or future applicable act or legislative&#xA;text, said act or legislative text shall prevail, and the Parties&#xA;shall make the necessary amendments so as to comply with said&#xA;act or legislative text. All other provisions shall remain effective.&#xA;Similarly, invalidity of a provision of the Agreement, for any&#xA;reason whatsoever, shall not cause the Agreement as a whole to&#xA;be invalid.&#xA;11.5 LANGUAGE&#xA;The Agreement is drafted in both French and English and both&#xA;versions are deemed authentic.&#xA;Article 12 - NEW VERSIONS OF THE AGREEMENT&#xA;12.1 Any person is authorized to duplicate and distribute copies&#xA;of this Agreement.&#xA;12.2 So as to ensure coherence, the wording of this Agreement&#xA;is protected and may only be modified by the authors of the License,&#xA;who reserve the right to periodically publish updates or new&#xA;versions of the Agreement, each with a separate number.
